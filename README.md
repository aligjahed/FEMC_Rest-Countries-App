## About The Project
This solution is for a challenge provided by <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/">Frontendmentor.io</a>.
<br></br>
In this projects i used <a href="https://restcountries.com/">REST Countries API</a> to fetch data from countries all around the world and combined it with javascript to dynamically make databox for each country and display it on the page.
<br></br>
This Project has two diffrent pages and use <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp">Local Storage</a> to pass data between pages.It's fully responsive and contains Dark/Light color themes which will stay the same even if page closes, again with the help of Local storage.
