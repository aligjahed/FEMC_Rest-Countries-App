# Rest Countries API - Frontend Mentor Challenge

Hey,
This is my try on [this](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca) Frontend Mentor challenge.
I used Html , Scss and Javascript for this project and "localstorage" to send information between pages.
This project contains "search" and "region selection" functions which uses Javascript Includes() to perform.
